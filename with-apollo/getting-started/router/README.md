# Apollo Router

Follow step 1 of [Apollo Router quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/quickstart/) to download and run the router.

You execution should like this to run the router against your `lynx` supergraph after downloading the router.

```
APOLLO_KEY='service:lynx-n321j:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="lynx-n321j@current" ./router
```

This results in the supergraph running in the router locally with a GraphQL endpoint of:

```
http://localhost:4000
```
