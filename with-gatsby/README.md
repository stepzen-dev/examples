# StepZen Example: `with-gatsby`

## Introduction

This project is a Gatsby starter repo connected to StepZen.

## Getting Started

You'll need to create a StepZen account first. Once you've got that set up, git clone this repository onto your machine and open the working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples.git
cd examples/with-gatsby
```

## Install Dependencies and Start Development Server

Install the dependencies using `npm` or Yarn:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Run StepZen

Open your terminal and [install the StepZen CLI](https://stepzen.com/docs/quick-start):

```bash
npm install -g stepzen
```

You need to login here using the command:

```bash
stepzen login
```

After you've installed the CLI and logged in, run:

```bash
stepzen start
```

In you terminal the endpoint at which your GraphQL API is deployed is logged. A proxy of the GraphiQL playground is available at your suggested endpoint (in example `http://localhost:5001/api/with-gatsby`), which you can use to explore the GraphQL API.
