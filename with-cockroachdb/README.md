# StepZen Example: `with-cockroachdb`

## Introduction

This project builds a GraphQL API connected to CockroachDB using StepZen. [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/) is a cloud-native database with PostgreSQL compatibility.

## Getting Started

You'll need to create a [StepZen account](https://stepzen.com/request-invite) first. Once you've got that set up, [git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) this repository onto your machine and open the working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples.git
cd examples/with-cockroachdb
```

Before you can run this example, you need to have a CockroachDB cluster. Which you can set up in the next section.

## Set up CockroachDB

CockroachDB can be set up in the cloud or self-hosted. In this example, we'll use a serverless cloud version that you can set up in a few steps. First, you need to create an account, after which you can create and populate a new CockroachDB cluster.

### Create an account and cluster

1. Create an account on [CockroachDB](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup)

2. Create a new CockroachDB cluster. You need to select what cloud provider you want your cluster to be deployed on and in which region.

3. After pressing "create" a new cluster with a database will be created.

4. Get the connection details for CockroachDB by pressing "Connect". Here you'll find multiple ways to connect with CockroachDB. You can get the commands to connect with CockroachDB over the command line, the connection string (`dsn`), or the connection credentials themselves.

5. Connect to your CockroachDB database cluster from your command line, by executing the following commands that you can copy-paste from the previous step:

   - Download the CRDB client if you havenâ€™t already done it before.

   `curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v21.2.5.darwin-10.9-amd64.tgz | tar -xz; sudo cp -i cockroach-v21.2.5.darwin-10.9-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/`

   - Run this command to connect to your database. Copy-paste the command from the CockroachDB dashboard, and it will look something like the following:

   `cockroach sql --url "postgresql://<COCKROACHDB_USERNAME>:<COCKROACHDB_PASSWORD>@<COCKROACHDB_HOST>:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full&options=--cluster%3D<DATABASE_NAME>"`

6. The CockroachDB CLI will respond with the following message. In the next section, you can use this console to populate the CockroachDB database.

```bash
#
# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit, type: \q.
#
```

Your CockroachDB cluster is now available on the cloud provider you previously selected.

### Populate with data

The CockroachDB database needs to be populated with the schema and data from the file `init.sql`. You can either import this data using the Cloud Console, CockroachDB Client or *psql*.

### Copy credentials

To connect StepZen and CockroachDB, you need to get your connection string for the cluster. You can find this by opening your cluster in the CockroachDB dashboard and pressing the "Connection" button (as explained in [Create an account and cluster](#create-an-account-and-cluster)).

You can copy the file `sample.config.yaml` to a new `config.yaml` file:

```bash
cp stepzen/sample.config.yaml stepzen/config.yaml
```

Replace the contents of `config.yaml` with your instance configuration:

```yaml
# stepzen/config.yaml

configurationset:
  - configuration:
      name: postgresql_config
      uri: YOUR_COCKROACHDB_DSN
```

## Run StepZen

Open your terminal and [install the StepZen CLI](https://stepzen.com/docs/quick-start/install-and-setup):

```bash
npm install -g stepzen
```

You need to login here using the command:

```bash
stepzen login
```

After you've installed the CLI and logged in, run:

```bash
stepzen start
```

A proxy of the GraphiQL playground becomes available at `http://localhost/5001` (in example `http://localhost:5001/api/with-cockroachdb`), which you can use to explore the GraphQL API. Also, the endpoint at which your GraphQL API is deployed gets logged in the terminal. You can query your GraphQL API from any application, browser, or IDE by providing the API Key linked to your account.
