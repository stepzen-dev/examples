# StepZen Example: `with-auth0`

## Introduction

This project builds a GraphQL API connected to Auth0. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a cloud-based identity management platform that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web, mobile, IoT, and internal applications.

## Getting Started

You'll need to create a [StepZen account](https://stepzen.com/request-invite) first. Once you've got that set up, [git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) this repository onto your machine and open the working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples.git
cd examples/with-auth0
```

This project shows how to use Auth0 to authenticate users and authorize them to access data using OAuth 2.0, using two different flows:

- [Authorization Code Flow](/authorization-jwt) - used for frontend applications
- [Client Credentials Flow](/client-credentials) - used for machine-to-machine communication

Open the `README.md` file in the `authorization-jwt` or `client-credentials` directory to learn how to set up Auth0 for that flow.
